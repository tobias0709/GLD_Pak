The current code is designed to be run directly from the GLD_I2D2_MAIN.do script. This sets the global `GLD` which is called in each year's I2D2 script to set the file path. If you desire to run the script directly from the specific year's code file, you will need to change this file path in the local `year` to the appropriate path.
