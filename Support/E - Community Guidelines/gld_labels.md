# GLD Labels

The GLD team created a list of labels to help users find country specific issues and information. 

The country labels should be the three letter code corresponding to the country in question following [ISO codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3)

For example: 

| Label	| Meaning	|
| :-------	| :--------		| 
| BRA	| Issues linked to Brasil surveys | 
| IDN	| Issues linked to India surveys| 
| IND	| Issues linked to Indonesia surveys| 
| MEX	| Issues linked to Mexico surveys|
| PAK	| Issues linked to Pakistan surveys|
| PHL | Issues linked to The Philippines surveys |
| TUR	| Issues linked to Turkey surveys |
| ZAF	| Issues linked to South Africa surveys |
| ZWE	| Issues linked to Zimbabwe surveys|
| COL	| Issues linked to Colombia surveys|


Other issues: In some instances, the team created labels to alert about a major issue that could be recurrent across different surveys. In most cases these issues are only handled by the focal GLD team, however if you want to contribute send an email to gld@worldbank.org to discuss if your experience matches the needs of the issue in question.
