## Detailed historical changes to Indonesia's provicnes

Quite a few historical changes happened to administrative divisions in Indonesia during the time period of interest considering the long duration. The provinces and districts in SAKERNAS do not necessarily reflect the real administrative divisions in the same year. For example, in SAKERNAS 1991 and 1993, there are only 24 unique province codes in the raw datasets and only 9 of 24 appear in other years. However, since they are unlabelled, we did not map 1991 and 1993 to other years, meaning all provinces in the table below will not appear in 1991 and 1993. Another example is that 54-Timur Timor (or East Timor) became independent from Indonesia in 2002 but SAKERNAS excludes Timur Timor since 2000.

One reason is because of the time lag – SAKERNAS might still used the old names and coding for provinces even though the system has been changed. Or on the contrary, SAKERNAS had acted before the change actually happened. The other reason is the lack of information about province names or inconsistent coding of divisions in some years. For our harmonization purpose, we used province names in the last harmonized year, 2019, as the standard version for all years' provinces; and year 2013 for all years' districts.

## Summary

1. SAKERNAS is significant at **province** level: 1989-2006 ; siginificant at **district** level: 2007-2019
2. Number of province changes from 27 in 1989 to 34 in 2019
3. Year 1991 and year 1993 might use other coding scheme for province. The raw data of these two years only contain 24 unique codes (see the screenshot of 1991 below). without labels. As they are unlabelled, they cannot be fully comprehended and were not mapped to other years. Users who want to have a time series of province are advised to drop 1991 and 1993.

## Particularities about admin codes in Western New Guinea

Western New Guinea represents the western half of the island of New Guinea, which is governed by Indonesia. The eastern half is the independent nation of Papua New Guinea. The administrative codes for areas in Western New Guinea reflect changes in the governance of the region that are worth detailing further.

Western New Guinea was first included in Sakernas in 2001. Until 2000 it had been a single province called "Papua". In 2001 and 2002 it was split into three provinces: `91 – Papua`, `92 - Irian Jaya Tengah`, and `93 - Irian Jaya Timur`. As such they enter Sakernas.

From 2003 to 2005 the survey only has a single administrative code for the area: code `94 – Papua`.

From 2006 onwards, the code `91` reemerges (only now labelled Papua Barat or West Papua) and code `94 - Papua` continues to exist yet with fewer observations (as West Papua's code `91` has been carved out).

It may be possible to extract Western Papua for the years 2003 to 2005 as the district information (`subnatid2`) labels the districts of what is Papua in 2006 onwards and has some missing values that roughly equal the size of `91 Papua Barat` in 2006. Thus in those three years it may be feasible to code:

```
replace subnatid1 = "91 - Papua Barat" if subnatid1 == "94 - PAPUA" & missing(subnatid2)
```

However, this - albeit logical - has not been confirmed and we do not know whether the survey design makes estimates for West Papua in 2003 to 2005 feasible.
