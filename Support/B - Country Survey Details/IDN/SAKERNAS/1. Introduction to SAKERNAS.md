# Introduction to Indonesian labor force survey – Survei Angkatan Kerja Nasional (SAKERNAS)


## What is the IDN SAKERNAS?

The National Labor Force Survey (or Survei Angkatan Kerja Nasional, SAKERNAS) is a household-based sample survey conducted by Badan Pusat Statistik (BPS) – Statistics Indonesia. Starting from 1976, SAKERNAS was implemented firstly as a module of the National Socio-Economic Survey (SUSENAS). It was separated from SUSENAS and conducted quarterly since 1986. 


## What does the IDN SAKERNAS cover?

The IDN SAKERNAS mainly covers information on demographic details, including age, sex, marital status, and location, education, and labour market activities over the previous 7 days. In recent years (i.e., 2016-2019), SAKERNAS has become more detailed and covers individuals' health conditions and social security status. Years used for harmonization are from 1989 to 2019 except that 1995 was dropped as SAKERNAS was not conducted in that year. We did not harmonize 1995 although Intercensal Population Survey 1995 can be used as a substitute for it. 

Since 2005, each year has two rounds available for harmonization, Feburary round and August round. We used the one with the larger sample size, which would usually be the August round. Only 2005 has a larger sample size in its Feburary round. There are apparent growths in number and dimension of the variables included in each year's survey over years.

Years and sample size of SAKERNAS harmonized for GLD are:

| 2019  | N/A        | 782,789        |  197,911,777     |

Note that even though SAKERNAS is a household-based survey and it indeed has household-related variables in some years, not every year's raw dataset provides complete location identification information for unique household ID generation. In those years, the methodology does also not allow for the creation of household level estimates. Therefore, numbers of household are not available (N/A) in the table above for those years without household IDs.


## Where can the data be found?

The microdata of SAKERNAS are not publicly available. The raw data we used were acquired by filling in a data request form and then shared by the World Bank Indonesia Team. Data can also be purchased from the BPS' Statistics Service Information System ([link here](https://silastik.bps.go.id/v3/index.php/site/login/) - requires login)



## What is the sampling procedure?

SAKERNAS uses a two-stage cluster sampling method in general, which includes two steps: 1) selecting the main sampling unit – census blocks and 2) selecting the ultimate sampling unit – households within each main sampling unit. As the frequency of data collection and level of data representativeness have changed over time, the implementation of sample selection methods also changed. For example, year 2007 is a dividing line in that all years before 2007 can only produce representative estimates up to province level whereas all years after 2007 (including 2007) have representativeness at district level except for the August round of 2016. The exception of year 2016 is because of the reduction on its sample size, which was reduced from 200,000 households to 50,000 households. The knowledge product, *A Guide to Working with Indonesian Survey Data* (
hereinafter referred to as *The Guide*),  written by the Poverty Global Practice of the World Bank Group outlines the sampling procedure as:
   
```
Probability Proportional to Size method (PPS) is used when selecting census block from Master Sampling Frame (MSF) which contains the list of primary sampling units (PSU or wilcah/wilayah pencacahan). Sampling frame for the annual Sakernas was
developed using the results of population census conducted previously before the respective Sakernas was conducted, while sampling frame for the quarterly Sakernas was obtained from the sampling frame of Susenas. For example, sampling frame for Sakernas 2003 was derived from the results of 2000 Population Census (SP2000), while sampling frame used in Sakernas 2011 was coming from Susenas 2011 sampling frame.

After census blocks were selected, a systematical random sampling method is then used to select households
within census block (16 households per census block before 2011 and 10 households per census block since 2011). To
describe more clearly about how the sampling is done in Sakernas, this chapter covers two specific examples, i.e. for
Sakernas 2007 to 2010 and 2011 to 2015.

In Sakernas 2007 to 2010, the Master Sampling Frame was developed using the results of 2006 Economic
Census. Sampling procedure was done by district/city and was separated between urban and rural areas. For each
district/city, there were two stages sampling method as follows:

1.First stage: From the MSF, n(h) census blocks were selected (h=1 for urban and h=0 for rural) using Probability
Proportional to Size (PPS) method.

2.Second stage: From each census block that had been selected in the first stage, 16 households were selected
using a systematic random sampling method.

In Sakernas 2011 to 2015, the Master Sampling Frame is developed using the results of 2010 Population Census
(SP2010), which has been updated every time before the survey will take place. Starting from 2011, the period in which
Sakernas began to be conducted quarterly, household samples are selected using three-stage withdrawal, with the
following steps:

1.First stage: From the MSF, 30,000 PSUs are selected for Susenas sampling frame by using the method of PPS.
These 30,000 PSUs are then randomly allocated evenly for each quarter of Susenas, i.e. 7,500 PSU for each
quarter. From 7,500 PSUs of Susenas Quarter I, 5,000 PSUs were systematically selected to be used for Sakernas
Quarter I (February), and will be used again for Sakernas Quarters II (May), III (August), and IV (November).

2.Second stage: From each PSU in the 5,000 selected PSUs, two census blocks were selected using PPS method,
proportional to number of households based on SP2010 results. These selected census blocks were then
randomly allocated for Susenas and Sakernas (1 census block for Susenas and 1 census block for Sakernas). The
selected census blocks for Sakernas were utilized for provincial estimates and divided into 4 sample packages,
each of which consists of 1,250 census blocks.

3.Third stage: From each census block selected in the second stage, 10 households were selected using
systematic random sampling.

## What is the geographic significance level?

The official reports detail results by gender, sector (i.e. urban or rural), province, and district (or kab). Province is the first administrative level at which data from 1989 to 2006 are representative whereas district is the second level at which data from 2007 to 2019 are representative. Variable `subnatid1_prev1` in the harmonized dataset shows how the provinces change throughout time. More details about historical changes to administrative divisions can be found in this separate [document](Geographic_Significance_Level.md).


## Other noteworthy aspects


### Unique Household ID Generation

Household IDs are not directly available in SAKERNAS regardless of year. Location identifiers such as province, district, sector (urban or rural) etc. can be used to generate household IDs. However, these location identifiers are not necessarily fully available in all survey years. We created household IDs using STATA codes provided by the *The Guide* for years that have the full list of location identifiers required.

![STATA_HHID_codes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84488698/163726938-8dfafff8-f195-442f-bef7-6f3a9f9843f9.png)

Household IDs were only created if 1) the given year has the full list of identifiers and 2) the number of households generated using this method matches the household sample size in *The Guide*. Because *The Guide* only provides a range of household sample size for several years in rounded number, it is possible that our self-created household number is not equal to the exact number of household in a specific year. The table below shows the availability of location identifiers in each year and if they have household ID.  

| **Year**	    | **Location Identifiers Available**	| **HHID created?** | 
| :-------:	 | :------------------------------: | :-----------: | 
| 1989       | province, district, sector, sample code number, household sample sequential number, serial number of households| No | 
| 1990-1994  | province, district, sector, sample code number, household sample sequential number, serial number of households| Yes|  
| 1996-2001  | province, district, sub-district, village, sector, sample code number, household sample sequential number| Yes |  
| 2002       | province, district, sector, sample code number, household sample sequential number | Yes|  
| 2003-2008  | province, district, sub-district, village, sector, sample code number, household sample sequential number| Yes |  
| 2009       | province, district, sector, household sample sequential number|No| 
| 2010-2019  | province, district, sector| No| 


### Definition of Labor Status and Labor Force Participation

From 1989 to 2019, the structure of SAKERNAS, especially the labor force module has changed greatly. Not only does the number of labor-related questions increase, but also the logic as well as the order of questions change. Although our definition of the GLD variable `lstatus` and `potential_lf` never change, still, we needed to find the most appropriate question or a set of questions in the suvey to define the two variables, which sometimes requires slight adaptation. In order to make sure that we understood the intention and the logic of the questions and made adaptations correctly, we used labor force participation rate in the report from [International Labour Organization (ILO) microdata library](https://www.ilo.org/surveyLib/index.php/catalog) ([here](utilities/IDN_2015_LFS_AUG_Report.pdf) is an example of 2015) as a benchmark for years with adaptations. But only 2014-2017 has detailed employed population, unemployed population and non-labor force data from ILO. We also used [World Bank country indicators](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.TLF.CACT.ZS?end=2020&locations=ID&start=2000) as a general reference. Here are some brief explanations. A more comprehensive explanation of the harmonization choices [is covered here in a separate document](Labor_Status_and_Labor_Force_Participation.md).    

All the harmonized years can be grouped into three categories: 

1) 1989-1999: the questionnaires of these years follow the same structure and have the same labor force module questions. Simply following the order of the questions can locate all the conditions needed to decide the employed, the unemployed, and non-labor force population. 
2) 2000-2016：the labor force module has become more complete (and complex). Questions are more well-guided during this time period. The *Only for Working Household Members* block states clearly the requirements for people to answer this block, which is a clear clue to code employed people.
3) 2017-2019: the last three years have the most up-to-date questionnaire structure, which adds details like work environment and welfare. Yet, while the block on employment status question increases and expands, the previous order was discarded and guide becomes blurred. Following the logic of the questionnaire would not produce sound labor force participation rate. We slightly changed the way we coded `lstatus` so as to get close to the ILO estimates.

Finally, it is worth pointing out that the age required for education and labor force modules changed between 2016 and 2017: 10 years old for years 1989-2016 whereas it is 5 for 2017-2019.        


### Coding of industry and occupation codes

Regarding industrial classification, 5 versions of Indonesian Standard Industrial Classification (KBLI) were involved from 1989 to 2019 – KLUI1997, KBLI2000, KBLI2005, KBLI2009, and KBLI2015. They were based on different versions of ISIC and were used in different years of SAKERNAS. in the [separate document.](Correspondence_National_International_Classifications.md) 

Although four versions of Indonesian Standard Occupational Codes (KBJI) were involved – KBJI1982, KBJI2000, KBJI2002, KBJI2014, we only used KBJI1982 and KBJI2002 during our mappiong process. Some years of SAKERNAS provide three versions of KBJI in the raw datasets yet with differet degrees of specifications. For example, SAKERNAS 2011 has KBJI 1982 three digits, 2000 1 digit and 2002 1 digit. But KBJI1982 three digits is the version we used most since it carries more information on occupation. 

Details about industrial and occuaptional mappings are covered in this [separate document.](Correspondence_National_International_Classifications.md)
