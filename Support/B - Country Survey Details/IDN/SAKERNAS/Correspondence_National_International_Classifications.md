# Correspondences between national and international classifications

This document describes the methodology used to map national industrial and occupational codes to their international counterparts. For industry, five versions of national classification, *Klasifikasi Baku Lapangan Usaha Indonesia (KBLI)*, were mapped to two versions of *International Standard Industrial Classification of all Economic Activities (ISIC)*; regarding occupation, two versions of national classification, *Klasifikasi Baku Jenis Pekerjaan Indonesia (KBJI)*, were mapped to two versions of *International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO)*. Specific versions mapped for each year harmonized are summarized in the table below along with internal links to the docs.

| **Version of KBJI**	| **Corresponding ISCO**	| 
| :-----------------------:	| :-------:	| 
| [1982](utilities/KBJI-1982.pdf)  | ISCO 1968| 
| [2002](utilities/KBJI-2002.pdf)  | ISCO 1988| 

|**Version of KBLI**	| **Corresponding ISIC**	|
| :-----------------: |:-----------------------:|	 	 
| [1997](utilities/KBLI-1997.pdf) | ISIC Rev.3| 
| [2000](utilities/KBLI-2000.pdf) | ISIC Rev.3|
| [2005](utilities/KBLI-2005.pdf) | ISIC Rev.3|
| [2009](utilities/KBLI-2009.pdf) | ISIC Rev.4|
| [2015](utilities/KBLI-2015.pdf) | ISIC Rev.4|

In general, we only mapped 1994-2018 as earlier years like 1989-1993 do not have two-digit industrial or occupational codes; and recent year, 2019, only has one-digit variables which directly corresponds to the top level of ISIC/ISCO. 

Years between 2011 and 2015 have multiple variables using different versions of KBJI and KBLI at different digital levels. The decision rule for choosing one version is *the newest version with at least two digits*.


*(We will update this documentation along with IDN GLD if we get more information on correspondence tables for KBJI and KBLI in the future. Please feel free to contact the GLD focal point (gld@worldbank.org) if you know anything that might help map Indonesia's industrial or occupational codes. Thanks!)*


## Correspondence in industry classification

**KBLI 1997 to ISIC Rev.3**

The KBLI-1997 document has an Indonesian version at three-digit level online for free, as the link attached above in the table. KBLI-1997 has more sub-categories than ISIC Rev.3 at three-digit level. In these cases, we mapped additional sub-categories in KBLI-1997 to their upper level. Below we listed the differences between the two classifications and how we mapped them. The full correspondence table is [here](utilities/Industry correspondences.xlsx) with an English version of KBLI-1997 translated by online software.

**KBLI 2000 to ISIC Rev.3**

The KBLI-2000 document has an English version available online. At three-digit level, it is same as KBLI-1997. So mapping different categories for KBLI-2000 to ISIC Rev.3 is same as KBLI-1997. Kindly refer to the table in the last section. 

**KBLI 2005 to ISIC Rev.3**

The KBLI-2005 document is in Indonesian but it compares not only between KBLI 2005 and ISIC Rev.3 but also between KBLI-2005 and KBLI-2009. KBLI-2005 follows the same structure as ISIC Rev.3, which has 15 major groups. The differences between KBLI-2005 and ISIC Rev.3 at two-digit level are quite rare. Here is a short list showing the differences when mapping at two-digit level. The full correspondence table is [here](utilities/Industry correspondences.xlsx) with an English version of KBLI-2005 translated by online software.

| **KBLI-2005 Code**	| **KBLI-2005 Industry**	| **ISIC Rev.3 Code**	| **ISIC Rev.3 Industry**	|
| :-----------------------:	| :---------------------------:	| :-------------:|:----------------:|

| 00 | Activities that has no clear boundaries               | -  |  (Coded missing)|


**KBLI 2009 & KBLI 2015 to ISIC Rev.4**


The KBLI-2015 document in the summary table above is only available in Indonesian. But it has a complete correspondence table with ISIC Rev.4 showing all the differences (see the picture below) and another one compared to KBLI-2009 from which KBLI-2015 was adapted. Here are the differences between the two classifications.


**Example of the correspondence between KBLI-2015 and ISIC Rev.4**

![example_KBLI15_ISIC](utilities/example_KBLI15_ISIC.png)


**Example of the correspondence between KBLI-2015 and KBLI-2009**

![example_KBLI15_KBLI09](utilities/example_KBLI15_KBLI09.png)


The structure of KBLI-2015 is almost the same as KBLI-2009 and ISIC Rev.4. As being described in the documentation attached above: 

>Klasifikasi KBLI 2015 terdiri dari struktur pengklasifikasian aktivitas ekonomi yang konsisten dan saling berhubungan, didasarkan pada konsep, definisi, prinsip, dan tatacara pengklasifikasian yang telah disepakati secara internasional. Struktur klasifikasi menunjukkan format standar untuk mengelola informasi rinci tentang keadaan ekonomi, sesuai prinsip-prinsip dan persepsi ekonomi.

>Secara umum, baik KBLI 2015 dan KBLI 2009 Cetakan III masih mengacu pada rujukan yang sama yaitu ISIC Rev. 4 yang terdiri dari 21 kategori. Perubahan struktur berupa pergeseran atau pengelompokkan suatu kegiatan dari satu klasifikasi ke klasifikasi lainnya, dan penambahan klasifikasi baru yang disebabkan adanya perkembangan aktivitas ekonomi, memungkinkan untuk terbentuknya kelompok yang berdiri sendiri atau digabungkan dengan kategori lain yang lebih sesuai.

Translated by online software as:

>The 2015 KBLI classification consists of a classification structure consistent and interconnected with economic activity, based on concepts, definitions, principles, and classification procedures that has been agreed internationally. Classification structure shows standard format for managing detailed information about the state economy, according to economic principles and perceptions.

>In general, both KBLI-2015 and KBLI-2009 (ver. III) still refers to the same reference, namely ISIC Rev.4 which consists of 21 categories. Changes happened in the form of shifts or grouping an activity from one classification to another.    


**Categories and Groupings of KBLI-2015**

| **Structure of KBLI-15**	| **Digit**	| **Quantity**	|
| :-----------------------:	| :-------:	| :-------------:	 	
| Category  | Alphabet        | 21|  
| Main Group  | 2-digit        | 88 |  
| Group  | 3-digit       | 240   |  
| Subgroup | 4-digit        | 520|  
| Group | 5-digit        | 1573  |  


Balancing between the level of precision and difficulty of mapping, we mapped KBLI-2015 to ISIC at a three-digit level, as the differences at three-digit level can be easily located and manually recoded. The table below shows all the differences between KBLI-2015 and ISIC, and those between KBLI-2009 and ISIC. When mapping KBLI to ISIC, for example, KBLI code 073 will be coded as ISIC 072.

## Correspondence in occupation classification

**KBLJI 1982 to ISCO 1968**

KBJI-1982 was used for most of the years as it constantly exists in the harmonized years with three digits. In terms of structure, it categorizes occupations in the same way as ISCO-1968 does. Similar to industry correspondence described above, several categories in KBJI-1982 have more subcategories than ISCO-1968's, which requests a good number of recoding. Therefore, the mapping work mainly refers to mapping additional KBJI subcategories to broader, more general subcategories in ISCO-1968. The table below shows the differences between the two classifications and how they were mapped.   

| **KBLI-1982 Code**	| **KBLI-1982 Industry**	| **ISCO 1968 Code**	| **ISCO 1968 Industry**	|

**KBJI 2002 to ISCO 1988**

Same as ISCO 1988, KBJI-2002 also has 0 to 9, 10 major groups in total. At three-digit level, only category 2 "Professionals", categroy 3 "Technicians and associate professionals", and category 0 "Armed forces" have different numbers of subgroups. KBJI-2002 has 19 whereas ISCO has 18 in category 2; and KBJI has 19 compared to 21 in ISCO's category 3; and 5 in KBJI category 0 versus 1 in ISCO. Therefore, we only recoded subgroups in "Professionals", "Technicians and associate professionals", and "Armed forces".

## Coding of variable `occup` from ISCO-68

The GLD team has not found any satisfactory correspondence table between ISCO-1968 and ISCO-88 or 2008, allowing to then use the first digit of that classification to create the variable `occup`. In the Indonesian context there is a special case that allows such comparison. Namely, in the years 2011 to 2015, the raw data contains occupation information both in KJI 1982 format (equivalent to ISCO-68, at 3-digit level) and KBJI 2002 format (equivalent to ISCO-88, at 1 digit). The raw data from all these years is appended and an intra-Indonesian mapping between both classifications is created to allow us to map the one-digit KBJI 2002 code (equivalent to `occup`) in the years 2000 to 2005, when the raw data only contains KJI1982 data at three digits. This is not done for the years 1994 to 1999 when the KJI1982 information is only at two digits.

The mapping algorithm, which divides between urban and rural assignments for greater accuracy, [can be found here](utilities/IDN_correspondence_KBJI.do), the outputted `.dta` file used to do the mapping [can be downloaded here](utilities/Additional%20Data/occup.dta).
