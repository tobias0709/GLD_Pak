# Changes in Geographic codes

As of August 2022, Thailand has 76 provinces (changwat) and one administrative area representing Bangkok. IThe provinces are grouped by the NSO into 5 regions: Bangkok Metropolis, Central, Northern, Northeastern and Southern.

In GLD the regions are coded under the `subnatid1` variable while provinces are coded as `subnatid2`

Over the years covered, there were changes in the province composition as new provinces are formed out of existing ones. In 1993, three provinces were created: Sa Kaeo (from Prachinburi province), Amnat Charoen (from Ubon Ratchathani province), and Nong Bua Lamphu (from Udon Thani province). These changes are reflected immediately in the 1994 survey. Also in 2011, 8 districts in province Nong Khai were separated to form a new province called Bueng Kan. This new province is immediately added in the 2012 survey. The below table provides and overview of the new provinces.
