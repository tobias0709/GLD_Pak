# Introduction to the South African Quarterly Labour Force Survey (QLFS)

## What is the ZAF QLFS?

The South African Quarterly Labour Force Survey (QLFS) is a household-based sample survey conducted by Statistics South Africa (Stats SA). It is a result of a major revision to the Labour Force Survey (LFS) and now becomes the principal tool for labour market data collection from 2005 to 2021.

## What does the ZAF QLFS cover?

The ZAF QLFS mainly covers information on demographic details, including age, sex, marital status, location, and education (both academic and vocational), labour market activities, as well as time use and activities over the previous 7 days. Information collected by the ZAF QLFS remains consistent over years. The years and sample size of QLFS harmonized for GLD are:

| Year	| # of Households	| # of Individuals	|
| :------:	| :-------:		| :-------:	 	|
| 2008  | 49,221        | 183,384        |
| 2009  | 47,334        | 173,412        |
| 2010  | 44,612        | 161,573        |
| 2011  | 45,044        | 160,350        |
| 2012  | 45,978        | 161,299        |
| 2013  | 46,440        | 166,387        |
| 2014  | 45,396        | 163,995        |
| 2015  | 40,778        | 139,961        |
| 2016  | 39,861        | 133,402        |
| 2017  | 39,418        | 132,713        |
| 2018  | 39,084        | 131,374        |
| 2019  | 38,611        | 129,184        |
| 2020  | 20,865        | 72,396         |

## Where can the data be found?

The microdata are free and publicly available on the [DataFirst](https://www.datafirst.uct.ac.za/dataportal/index.php/catalog/StatsSA) website, which provides research data service for African countries, especially for South Africa. DataFirst published all four quarters' data for each year of ZAF QLFS, from 2008 to 2021, as well as a related labor force survey, Labor Market Dynamics (LMDSA), which combines all four quarters together in one single data file. The website also provides all necessary documentation.

## What is the sampling procedure?

The QLFS has a stratified two-stage design. The probability is proportional to size sampling of primary sampling units in the first stage and sampling of dwelling units with systematic sampling in the second stage. The sample is designed in such way that it is representative at both provincial level and metro/non-metro level within each province. The survey design has remained the same since 2008. The 2008 guide (see document *Guide to the Quarterly Labour Force Survey* under the ["Documentation" section of the ZAF-STATSSA-QLFS-2008-Q1-V2.1 site](https://www.datafirst.uct.ac.za/dataportal/index.php/catalog/498/related-materials)) outlines the sampling procedure as:

    The Labour Force Survey frame has been developed as a general purpose household survey frame that can be used by all other household surveys irrespective of the sample size requirement of the survey. The sample size for the QLFS is roughly 30 000 dwellings and these are divided equally into four rotation groups, i.e. 7 500 dwellings per rotation group.

    The sample is based on information collected during the 2001 Population Census conducted by Stats SA. In preparation for the 2001 census, the country was divided into 80 787 enumeration areas (EAs). Some of these EAs are small in terms of the number of households that were enumerated in them at the time of Census 2001. Stats SA's household-based surveys use a Master Sample which comprises of EAs that are drawn from across the country. For the purposes of the Master Sample the EAs that contained less than 25 households were excluded from the sampling frame, and those that contained between 25 and 99 households were combined with other EAs to form Primary Sampling Units (PSUs). The number of EAs per PSU ranges between one and four. On the other hand, very large EAs represent two or more PSUs.

    The sample is designed to be representative at the provincial level and within provinces at the metro/non-metro level. Within the metros, the sample is further distributed by geography type. The four geography types are: urban formal, urban informal, farms and tribal. This implies that for example, that within a metropolitan area the sample is designed to be representative at the different geography types that may exist within that metro.

    The current sample size is 3 080 PSUs. It is equally divided into four sub-groups or panels called rotation groups. The rotation groups are designed in such a way that each of these groups has the same distribution pattern as that which is observed in the whole sample. They are numbered from one to four and these numbers also correspond to the quarters of the year in which the sample will be rotated for the particular group.

    The sample for the redesigned Labour Force Survey is based on a stratified two-stage design with probability proportional to size (PPS) sampling of primary sampling units (PSUs) in the first stage, and sampling of dwelling units (DUs) with systematic sampling in the second stage.

## What is the geographic significance level?

The official reports detail results by gender, sector (urban formal, urban informal, farms and tribal, mining areas etc.), province, and metro/non-metro area. Province is the first administrative level at which the survey sample is representative whereas metro/non-metro area is the second level.

Two things to be noted regarding geographic significance level:

1)  South Africa has 9 provinces which are currently divided into 52 districts. The 52 districts are further categorized into two types --- 44 non-metropolitan and 8 large city areas called metros. In the survey, the way of grouping these metro and non-metro areas changes before and after 2014. See more details below in the *"*[Changes in sub-national level categorization](#Changes-in-sub-national-level-categorization)*"* section.

2)  The original categorization of sector varies across years. Principally, the QLFS uses "Urban formal", "Urban informal", "Tribal areas", and "Farms and mining areas". But in no documentation does it clarify the categories in terms of urban/rural classification. See more details including the decision rule for harmonization below in the *"*[Coding of sector](#Coding-of-sector)*"* section.

## Other noteworthy aspects

### Difference from reported population

Sample sizes and expanded population (that is the total population estimated using the weights) are compared to the reported data in the publication "*Labour Market Dynamics in South Africa*" by the Statistics South Africa for all years. Reports can be found on DataFirst under "Reports" in the "DOCUMENTATION" section (i.e. 2019 quarter 1 can be found [here](https://www.datafirst.uct.ac.za/dataportal/index.php/catalog/764)). The expanded population estimated using raw data match exactly the numbers in reports of year 2010 to 2019 after rounding.

The table below shows raw and processed sample sizes, numbers of dropped observations, reported population, and estimated population using raw and processed data. For year 2008 and 2009, the estimates and reported numbers are fairly close, 49,562 versus 49,374 in 2008 and 50,224 versus 50,044 in thousands. "*Labour Market Dynamics in South Africa, 2020*" changed its content and structure and does not state total population. Therefore, the expanded population estimate in 2020 is not comparable.

The fourth column "\# Drops" shows the number of dropped observations in each year. All of these observations were dropped during household head assignment process. The original variable `PERSONNO` has its first digit as 1 if the respondent is a household head. But some households do not have any member whose `PERSONNO` starts with 1. This may be because that the head did not present, or he/she did not spend four nights or more in the household.

The decision rule we created to assign household heads in cases where heads are absent are as follows:

1.  assign the ***eldest male adult*** as the head;

2.  absent male members, assign the ***eldest female adult*** as the head;

3.  absent adult members, the household does not have any household head;

4.  if there are multiple same-age same-gender members in a given household, no head will be assigned;

5.  drop households that do not have heads;

6.  individuals who are assigned to be heads should be heads regardless of waves, meaning he or she is the head for all four quarters in a given year.

Consequently, the dropped observations shown in the table are all because there is no adult member or multiple same-age male (or female) members exist.

### Changes in sub-national level categorization

The original variable `metro_code` is used for the GLD variable `subnatid2` but the number of categories of this variable changes from 7 to 17 after 2014, meaning that it has 7 categories from 2008 to 2014 and 17 categories from 2015 to 2020.

South Africa has 6 metro cities before 2011 and the country added 2 metros, *Buffalo City (East London)* and *Mangaung (Bloemfontein)*, in 2011. But this change in administrative structure does not appear immediately in the QLFS. There is a 4-year lag. From 2008 to 2014, the 7 items on `metro_code` list are 6 metros plus 1 group which combining all other non-metro areas together. Since 2015, 6 metros expand to 8, and additionally, the single "non-metro" group is split into 9 according to the provinces those non-metros belong to.

### Coding of sector 

The original variable `Geo_type` in the QLFS is not an urban-or-rural binary variable. Moreover, it varies over years. As shown in the table below, from 2008 to 2015, `Geo_type` contains urban formal, urban informal, tribal areas, and rural formal. But since 2016, it has urban, traditional, and farm/mining areas.

We referred to the published statistics of urban population (% of total population) of South Africa from [World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.URB.TOTL.IN.ZS?end=2020&locations=ZA&start=2007) to decide the way of sector's harmonization. The original categories are re-grouped in such way that each year's result match World Bank's statistics correspondingly as close as possible.

|**Year**|                     **Original geo-type code**                    | **Re-categorization**         |

### Coding of industry and occupation codes

The QLFS of all years codes industry based on the [Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities, Fifth Edition (SIC 5)](http://www.statssa.gov.za/additional_services/sic/contents.htm), which is based upon the third revision of the International Standard Industrial Classification of all Economic Activities (ISIC Rev. 3) published in 1990.

Regarding occupational classification, all QLFS years code occupation based on [South African Standard Classification of Occupations published in 2003 (SASCO 2003)](http://www.statssa.gov.za/classifications/codelists/SASCO_2003.pdf), which is based on the United Nations' International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO-88). The details on the process of creating the correspondence between national and international classifications [are covered here in a separate document](/Support/B%20-%20Country%20Survey%20Details/ZAF/QLFS/Correspondence_National_International_Classifications.md).

### Assembling annual data using QLFS and LMDSA

As stated at the beginning, data is available freely on the [Data First website](https://www.datafirst.uct.ac.za/dataportal/index.php/catalog/StatsSA) as quarterly release (Quarterly Labour Force Survey - QLFS) and as a single, year-round data set (the Labour Market Dynamics in South Africa, LMDSA, file). All variables and observations remain the same in LMDSA except that the variable of weight is divided by four in LMDSA.

All years have both LMDSA and QLFS available on DataFirst, and therefore, we used LMDSA for harmonization because of its simplicity and QLFS for cross-checking purposes. Note that the [first version of the 2020 code](https://github.com/worldbank/gld/tree/main/GLD/ZAF/ZAF_2020_QLFS/ZAF_2020_QLFS_v01_M_v01_A_GLD/Programs) used QLFS data as LMDSA was not yet available. This has been updated in [ZAF_2020_QLFS_v02_M_v01_A_GLD](https://github.com/worldbank/gld/blob/main/GLD/ZAF/ZAF_2020_QLFS/ZAF_2020_QLFS_v02_M_v01_A_GLD/Programs/ZAF_2020_QLFS_v02_M_v01_A_GLD_ALL.do).

Moreover, years 2012 and 2016 need special attention. Using LMDSA alone for these two years is not enough because they both lose information to some degree. LMDSA 2012 does not contain variable `Q19ATTE` which is necessary for generating the GLD variable `school`. The solution is to append QLFSs in 2012 and extract `Q19ATTE` and merge it into LMDSA 2012. Similarly, LMDSA 2016 do not have complete information on `Geo_type`. This variable can be obtained from QLFS 2016 and brought into LMDSA 2016 to get the intermidiate dta file. Intermediate files for [2012](utilities/append_2012) and [2016](utilities/append_2012) are in the *utilities* folder.   

### Change in implementation

Note that the QLFS since March 2020 has switched from face-to-face interview to Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI). Accordingly, sample size was affected by the availability of contacts of the dwelling units. Therefore, according to the QLFS Q2 report, it is recommended to cautiously make comparisons with previous quarters. More details about quarterly data collection in 2020 below from a screenshot of 2020 Q2 report:
