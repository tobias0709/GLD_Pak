Education and Labor Modules Ages
================

-   [Terminology](#terminology)
-   [GLD](#gld)

A brief overview of the minimum applicable ages for the Education and Labor modules in each survey year.

## Terminology

Typically, each Labor Force Survey or equivalent will only ask education or labor-related sets of questions to relevant age groups, which are defined differently across time and place. Only if the respondent is of the minimum age or higher will the enumerator ask these education- or labor-related questions. Sometimes a maximum age limit exists as well.

The GLD strives to have the minimum education and labor module ages reflect those of the PSA publications, where available. The International Labour Organization has kindly archived the PSA’s quarterly report files for [most survey years](https://www.ilo.org/surveyLib/index.php/catalog/LFS#_r=&collection=&country=171&dtype=&from=1975&page=1&ps=30&sid=&sk=&sort_by=nation&sort_order=&to=2019&topic=&view=s&vk=), in which the labor minimum age is discussed. The PSA’s [Integrated Survey of Household Bulletin](https://psa.gov.ph/content/integrated-survey-households-ish-bulletin) reports also mention minimum labor ages based on their definition of employment, typically on the 12th page or so of the year-quarter’s PDF file or \~xii in the publication version. Furthermore, the Education Minimum ages are drawn from the respective survey questionnaire files. If no questionnaire file is available for a particular year, then the most closest available year’s survey minimum age is used.
