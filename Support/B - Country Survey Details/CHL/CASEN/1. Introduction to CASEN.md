## What is the CHL CASEN?

The Encuesta de **Ca**racterización **S**ocio**e**conomica **N**acional (CASEN - National Socioeconomic Characterisation Survey) is a Chilean household survey that contains sections for employment, education, dwellinga and income. The CASEN has been rolling since 1987. The GLD harmonization starts with 1990 a this is the first year wth public data (see section on where the data can be found below).  

## What does the CHL CASEN cover?

The CHL CASEN includes one labour section that collects information on employment situations of individuals surveyed. It further provides insights in the reasons for taking or not taking a job and the salary situation of the participant. In addition, other sections of CASEN cover demographic details (age, sex, location), education (academic), social security, labour market activities over the past week, as well as working hours and type of economic activities engaged. The years and sample size of CASEN harmonized for GLD are:

| Year	    | # of Households	| # of Individuals	|
| :-------	| :--------		    | :--------	 	      |
| 1990	    | 25,793	        | 105,189	          |

| 2017	    | 70,948          | 216,439	          |

## Where can the data be found?

The microdata is free and publicly available on the Ministry of Social Development website. The ministry created a [dedicated website](http://observatorio.ministeriodesarrollosocial.gob.cl/encuesta-casen) that records the results from CASEN, besides it contains complete information to understand the framework of the CASEN. For further information kindly get in touch with the World Bank Jobs Group. 

## What is the sampling procedure?

The CASEN uses a stratified two-stage design. In the first stage the primary sampling units (blocks in urban areas and "sections" in rural areas) are stratified and then selected with probability proportional to size. The second stage selects households in the primary sampling units with equal probability. the methodology may change slightly from year to year and users are advised to read the individual documents [here on the website](observatorio.ministeriodesarrollosocial.gob.cl/encuesta-casen-2017).

The website looks (as of April 2022) like the screenshot shown below. To find the documentation click on the methodology tab (red box) ensuring to be in the right year (green box). The document for 2017 is shown in the black box.

## What is the geographic significance level?

The results are significant at national, rural, urban, regional, and *cities of interest* levels as well as selected communities. The cities of interest and sizes of cities, however, may vary over time. It is thus important to check the individual methodology reports, as described in the previous section.

## Other Noteworthy Aspects 

### 2011 survey
For 2011, information on methodology and variables in the raw data is limited compared to other years. Moreover, in 2011, the National Statistics Institute (INE) and the Ministry of Social Development changed the survey design. The CASEN website only compiles details about the changes but does not present the information on the number of households or individuals surveyed. As a result, the GLD project harmonized the dataset but could not have compare the results (e.g., sample counts, population LFP estimates) against official releases as in other years.

### Region changes
In 2007 two new regions were created. The region of *Los Ríos* was carved out of Los Lagos and the region of *Arina y Parinacota* was carved out of Tarapacá. Thus, the data until 2006 has 13 regions and the data from 2009 on has 15 regions. The codes for regions 1 to 13 remain the same. Los Ríos has code 14 and Arica and Parinacota has code 15. The evolution is covered in `subnatid1_prev` in the 2009 harmonization.

### Province Information
Province information is coded under the variables subnatid2 for all years except 2011 and 2013 (information absent from the raw dataset). In addition, the codes are not consistent over time because the survey is not significant at the province level. In some instances, the code conferred to one province may change in the next because that year, the specific province was not considered by the sample design. Please, visit the CASEN methodology to learn more.

### ICLS Changes
Labour surveys or labour chapters in household surveys follow the versions published after the International Labour Statistics Conferences agree on a significant change in labour statistics definitions; visit this website to learn more.  In the CASEN, the NSO used the ICLS-13 definition until 2009 and the ICLS-19 from 2011 onwards. The main difference is in the economic activity definition to classify independent workers. The ICLS-13 type of question focus on independent workers' economic activities classified into one economic activity, self-work. The ICLS-19, survey questions focus on grouping activities of independent workers in subgroups such as independent work in agriculture or commerce.

### Who manages CASEN
It is important to note that though the INE is the manager of the survey design and implementation, CASEN is under the responsibility of the Ministry of Social Development. Thus, decisions on methodology and changes are handled by the ministry.
