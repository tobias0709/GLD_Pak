
# OCCUPATION CATEGORIES IN CASEN

The CASEN is not a labour survey, yet it contains a dedicated labour section with a short list of questions that describe the labour status of the surveyed population. 

Below we will describe the ISCO information available in the data harmonized following the documentation available in the official CASEN website.  Wherever posible we will provide details for the user, yet as some of the information publicly available is limited we encourage the user to get in touch with the INE or the Ministry of Social Development to get a more detailed breakdown. 

## List of ISCO version per year

 Year	| ISCO Version | 
| :-------	| :-------- | 
| 1990-2017	| ISCO 1988	|

The documentation reveals that the CASEN works with the 1988 ISCO codes.

There is a website from the INE that states a [new Chilean ISCO (CIUO) version](https://www.ine.cl/institucional/buenas-practicas/clasificaciones), but no information in the CASEN documentation suggests these were used in the survey. Furthermore, in the [documentation of CASEN](http://observatorio.ministeriodesarrollosocial.gob.cl/storage/docs/casen/2017/Libro_de_Codigos_Casen_2017.pdf) for the year 2017, it is stated that the ISCO classification used is ISCO 1988 (see page 252). 


## About codes that do not match the international ISCO classification

The years with occupation classification information have glitches on the labelling. Example:


ISCO 88 (ILO)	| ISCO 88 (CASEN) | 
| :-------	| :-------- | 
| 1	| 100	|
| 12	| 120|
| 122	| 122|


The ISCO classification has three levels. Level 1 has 1 digit and is the highest level. Level 2 has 2 digits and level 3 has 3 digits.  In the CASEN, though, the first level has three digits the same number of digits as the second level and the third, yet with further attention, one can notice that the first level in CASEN has two zeros next to the first digit, which makes it comparable to the ISCO classification. In the harmonization do-files, the team lists these abnormalities for the user to pay attention to before proceeding with the analysis.
