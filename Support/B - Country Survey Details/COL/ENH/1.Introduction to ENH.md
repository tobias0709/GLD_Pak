## What is the COL survey?

The ENH was the first survey to measure the Colombian labour market. The DANE applied the ENH since the 1970s in multipurpose samples. In the harmonized datasets, the GLD has included the 1996, 1999 and 2000 ENH surveys.

The 1996 manual (see document *Metodolog√≠a Encuesta Nacional de Hogares* under the ["Utilities Folder"](https://github.com/worldbank/gld/blob/823b1d2b8f4cd17abc3a79eb0a70b8f24e7696bf/Support/B%20-%20Country%20Survey%20Details/COL/ENH/Utilities/CEPAL_COLOMBIA_1996.pdf)) which outlines the sampling process.

## What is the geographic significance level?

The data covers national information at the urban and rural levels.
