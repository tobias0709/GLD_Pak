# About the ISIC classification

The ISIC classification used in the GEIH data follows the general principles of the international industry classification. However, the Colombian NSO decided to create its version of the ISIC classification to better identify industry groups important for the Colombian economic reality. 

## Between 2006 and 2019

The NSO used the Colombian version of ISIC rev. 3 to classify the economic activities in the GEIH. At the group level (3 digits) the sections mostly correspond to those on the ISIC international rev 3.1 classification yet at the four digit level there are some variations to the 3.1 classification. In the following [link](https://www.dane.gov.co/files/sen/nomenclatura/tablasCorrelativas/TablasCorrelativasCIIURev3_1A_C.pdf), the user can find the detailed explanation to the differences. The files harmonized and available in the GLD server have already considered the differences. 

## Between 2020 and 2021

In the year 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic affected the collection process of the GEIH data, as such the NSO created a ISIC classification to transition from the Colombian version ISIC 3 to the colombian version ISIC 4, (see the [correspondance table](https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dane.gov.co%2Ffiles%2Fsen%2Fnomenclatura%2FtablasCorrelativas%2FTC-CIIU-3ACvsCIIU-4AC-2020.xlsx&wdOrigin=BROWSELINK) for the changes in the Colombian version).  

As with the previous version, the Colombian version of ISIC 4 2020 had more similarities than differences to the international version, yet the differences are more evident at the four digit level, see the correspondence table [here](https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dane.gov.co%2Ffiles%2Fsen%2Fnomenclatura%2FtablasCorrelativas%2FTC-CIIU-4AC-2020-vsCIIU-4Int.xls&wdOrigin=BROWSELINK)

The 2021 data uses the same ISIC 4 Colombia version. If the user wants to compare it to the ISIC 4 international version, please use the same link from 2020.
