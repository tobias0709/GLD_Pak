## What is the PAK LFS?

The Pakistan Labor Force Survey (LFS) is a household-based sample survey conducted by the Federal Bureau of Statistics of Pakistan (BPS) regularly since 1963. This survey was firstly undertaken on quarterly basis in 2005; and became representative at district urban/rural level in 2020.


## What does the PAK LFS cover?

The PAK LFS mainly covers detailed information on demographic details, including age, sex, marital status, and location, education, and labour market activities over the previous 7 days. Since 1999, LFS began to include information on households' immigration status, such as whether a given household has migrated or not. Years used for harmonization range from 1992 to 2020 discontinuously, 15 years in total.

Years and sample size of LFS harmonized for GLD are:

| **Year**	| **# of Households**	| **# of Individuals**	| **Expanded Population**	| **Officially Reported Sample Size(# HH)**	|
| :------:	| :-------:		| :-------:	 	| :-------:	 	| :-------:	 	|
| 1992  | 20,118        | 129,109      |  85,910,233  |   N/A   |
| 1999  | 17,444        | 111,473      |  103,897,454 |  18,890 |
| 2001  | 18,889        | 122,233      |  116,718,126 |  18,890 |
| 2003  | 20,440        | 139,123      |  131,548,813 |  18,912 |
| 2005  | 32,638        | 219,969      |  130,728,041 |  32,744 |
| 2007  | 36,069        | 250,820      |  133,749,747 |  36,272 |
| 2008  | 36,253        | 249,216      |  134,247,447 |  36,400 |
| 2009  | 38,764        | 263,501      |  139,159,113 |   N/A   |
| 2010  | 38,818        | 260,894      |  178,987,341 |  36,420 |
| 2012  | 27,551        | 182,541      |  134,813,093 |  35,067 |
| 2013  | 35,067        | 228,224      |  181,714,956 |  40,747 |
| 2014  | 41,627        | 264,136      |  189,190,000 |  36,108 |
| 2017  | 43,248        | 272,490      |  185,760,595 |  43,472 |
| 2018  | 40,963        | 257,054      |  203,261,919 |  41,184 |
| 2020  | 96,440        | 570,991      |  207,976,697 |  99,904 |

1992 and 2009 do not have annual reports publicly available online, therefore, official number of sample size for these two years are missing.

Note that the number of households in our harmonized datasets do not equal the number of sample size in each year's annual report. We follow [coding scheme](coding_LFS_2017-18) by the BPS to code household identification variable `hhid`, which produces number of households. Though no observation dropped in any year, numbers we got differ from those in the annual reports for unknown reasons. Coding scheme documentation is an official guide that provides detailed information on how to use the original variable `PrCode`, process code, to get information on urban/rural status, household number, province, stratum etc. from a certain digit of the variable.  

## Where can the data be found?

The microdata of LFS from 2009 are publicly available on the official website of PBS through this [link](https://www.pbs.gov.pk/content/microdata). And accordingly, each year's report of 2007 to 2020 can be found through the [link here](https://www.pbs.gov.pk/content/all-reports-and-publications). Data prior to 2009 was shared internally with the World Bank.


## What is the sampling procedure?

LFS uses a two-stage cluster sampling method in general, which includes two steps: 1) selecting the primary sampling units (PSU), which are enumeration blocks in both urban and rural domains 2) selecting the secondary sampling units, which include listed households of sample PSUs. The first year of the GLD, 1992, is only nationally representative at urban/rural level; the last year of harmonization, 2020, is the only year that has district level of representativeness; and all years in between are representative at rural/urban level of the province.

More details of the sampling frame & procedure are included in each year's annual report. Here is an example of [LFS 2020](https://www.pbs.gov.pk/sites/default/files/labour_force/publications/lfs2020_21/LFS_2020-21_Report.pdf) (page 19/20 of the PDF):

```
Universe: The universe for Labour Force Survey consists of all urban and rural areas of the four provinces of Pakistan and Islamabad excluding military restricted areas. The population of excluded areas constitutes about 1% of the total population.

A stratified two-stage sample design is adopted for the survey.

Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) has developed its own sampling frame for both urban and rural domains. Each city/town is divided into enumeration blocks. Each enumeration block is comprised of 200 to 250 households on the average with well-defined boundaries and maps. The frame used in this survey was the most recent frame which is updated through Population and Housing Census 2017.

Rural Domain: Each administrative district in the Punjab, Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhawa (KP) is considered an independent stratum whereas in Balochistan, each administrative division constitutes a stratum.
Urban Domain: All administrative divisions in the four provinces, constitutes separate stratum.

Selection of primary sampling units (PSUs)
Enumeration blocks in both Urban and Rural domains are taken as Primary Sampling Units (PSUs). Sample PSUs from each ultimate stratum/sub-stratum are selected with probability proportional to size (PPS) method of sampling scheme. In both Urban and Rural domains, the number of households in an enumeration blocks considered as measure of size.

Selection of secondary sampling units (SSUs)
The listed households of sample PSUs are taken as Secondary Sampling Units (SSUs). A specified number of households i.e. 12 from each urban sample PSU and 16 from rural sample PSU are selected with equal probability using systematic sampling technique with a random start.

## What is the geographic significance level?

****************
*** COMMENT ***
text above says 1992 is only national (urban rural) the table below says it is province. Please confirm which one it is.
Also: for 2005 onward at least it is province + urban / rural
****************

The official reports detailed results by gender, sector (i.e. urban or rural), and the four main provinces in Pakistan – Punjab, Sindh, the North-West Frontier Province(N.W.F.P.), and Balochistan. Among the raw datasets of all LFSs, 2010, 2014, 2017, and 2018 are the only four years that contain more than the four major provinces. The table below shows provinces included in each year and the geographic significance level.

| **Year**	| **Province Covered**	| **Historical Change**	|
| :------:	| :-------------------: | :-------------------:	|
| 1992  | Punjab/Sindh/NWFP/Balochistan | N/A |  
| 1999  | Punjab/Sindh/NWFP/Balochistan | N/A |  
| 2001  | Punjab/Sindh/NWFP/Balochistan | N/A |
| 2003  | Punjab/Sindh/NWFP/Balochistan | N/A |
| 2005  | Punjab/Sindh/NWFP/Balochistan | N/A |
| 2007  | Punjab/Sindh/NWFP/Balochistan | N/A |
| 2008  | Punjab/Sindh/NWFP/Balochistan | N/A |  
| 2009  | Punjab/Sindh/NWFP/Balochistan | N/A |  
| 2010  | Punjab/Sindh/KP/Balochistan/AK,Kashmir/GB | The name of NWFP changed to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (or K/P province)|  
| 2012  | Punjab/Sindh/NWFP/Balochistan | N/A |  
| 2013  | Punjab/Sindh/NWFP/Balochistan | N/A |
| 2014  | Punjab/Sindh/KP/Balochistan/Islamabad| N/A |
| 2017  | Punjab/Sindh/KP/Balochistan/Islamabad| N/A |
| 2018  | Punjab/Sindh/KP/Balochistan/Islamabad| Federally Administered Tribal Areas, or "FATA" was merged into K/P|
| 2020  | Punjab/Sindh/KP/Balochistan   | N/A |  


## Other noteworthy aspects


### Definition of Labor Status and Labor Force Participation

LFS has its own conception and definition documentation for variables. These documents can be found on the International Labour Organization data catalog [website](https://www.ilo.org/surveyLib/index.php/catalog/?page=1&from=2000&to=2020&ps=15). When coding GLD variable `lstatus` and `potential_lf`, we need to adapt GLD definition for *being employed* and *unemployed* to fit LFS's own definition, and more often, this requires us to expand GLD definition.

Earlier years before 2012 are coded slightly differently from other years as they have less labor questions. A more comprehensive explanation of the harmonization choices [is covered here in a separate document](Labor_Status_and_Labor_Force_Participation.md).    


### Coding of industry and occupation codes

Regarding industrial classification, 3 versions of Pakistani Standard Industrial Classification (PSIC) were involved from 1992 to 2020 – PSIC 1970, 2007, 2010. They are based on different versions of ISIC and were used in different years of LFS. in the [separate document.](Correspondence_National_International_Classifications.md)

Although three versions of Pakistani Standard Occupational Codes (PSCO) were involved – PSCO 1994, 2011, and 2015, they are based on two versions of international standards which are ISCO 1988 AND 2008. PSCO 1994 follows ISCO 1988 whereas PSCO 2011 and 2015 follow ISCO 2008.

In general, each single version of national standards, regardless of industry or occupation, is almost identical to their international counterparts at two-digit level. Details about industrial and occuaptional mappings are covered in this [separate document.](Correspondence_National_International_Classifications.md)


### Helper files for district, migration country, and training field coding

We created several codelist for `subnatid2`, `migrated_from_code`, and `vocational_field_orig` according to PBS's coding scheme for each year. These files and their use can be found in the table below.
