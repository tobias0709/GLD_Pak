# Relevant information about the education section

The education section of the GLD harmonized dataset provides information to the user on the educational level of the individuals interviewed in the HLFS. Usually this section will ressemble fully the documentation from the raw dataset, yet, in this case the user will find useful addtional information to understand the decisions made on the harmonized files.

## The education section in the harmonized file

The education section contains variables that explain the concepts of literacy, education achieved and lenght of stay in formal education. To contruct these variables, the harmonization team used the variable age from the dataset and research papers with information about the education system changes in Turkey, the main external document used can be found [here](Utilities/education_paper.pdf). 

## Changes in the Turksish education system

The formal education system in turkey is divided into primary education, lower secondary education, upper secondary education and vocational training, and  higher education. Figure 1. shows the formal education system and the total years needed for completing each level.

The structure above changed in the past years due to improvements in curricula and definition of years of schooling and aged of pupils. According to Gun and Baskan (2014), different laws were passed between 1997 and 2012 that affected the education system of turkey. Table 1 below summarizes the changes and the importance of each. The most dramatic change took place in 2012 with the enactment of the 4+4+4 law that stated 4 years primary, 4 years elementary and 4 years high school to replace the previous law of 8 years of primary education.

| Year	    | Relevant Change	                                                                        |
| :-------	| :--------	 	                                                                            |
| Pre 1997	| 5 year primary education                                                                |
| 1997-2012	| Formal implementation of the the 8-year primary education system across the country	    |
| 2012	    | Extension of primary education from 8 to 12 years in the form of 4+4+4                  |

With the reform in 2012 the age of entrance to formal education changed to 5,5 years or 6 60-66 months, from the previous 69-80 months.

## Choices made

As a result of the above the harmonization team decided to take in consideration the changes in the education reform for the years 2000 to 2019. In particular the age of entry to formal education was considered 6 across all the files. The changes coming from the 4+4+4 to the structure of formal education were particularly adress for the primary education group. As a result, the user with access to the relevant files will find that files from 2000 TO 2013 have a different structure to those from 2014 to 2019 for educat7, educat5 and educat4.

## Nature of the data

The data from year 2000 to 2013 contains population from ages 0 to 99 while the files from 2014 to 2019 contain only data for the respondants in the age bracket 15 year plus. As a result, between years 2014 onwards there is little information to clasify the respondants under the categories of primary incomplete or basic education based on age solely.
