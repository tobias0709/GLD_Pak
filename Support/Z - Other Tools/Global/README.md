The Global Folder currently houses two (somewhat) working scripts: survey_metadata.R and label_tools.R.

survey_metadata.R takes all .dta files from a specified directory, creates .Rds files, and exports metadata files of all those survey files in an .Rdata file format.

label_tools.R uses the objects in the .Rdata file to actually do useful things. Please improve and fix!
